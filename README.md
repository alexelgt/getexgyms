# **Get EX gyms**
This bash script runs [osmcoverer](https://github.com/MzHub/osmcoverer) in such a way that it obtains EX gyms and "EX gyms" that are in a blocking zone.

## **Prerequisites**
You need to have [osmcoverer](https://github.com/MzHub/osmcoverer) on your computer and Windows' users also need to have [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com).

### **Windows prerequisites**
1. Go to [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com) and install it.

2. Open **Cygwin Terminal** (this will create some folders in **C:\\cygwin\\home**).

3. Go to [osmcoverer releases](https://github.com/MzHub/osmcoverer/releases), download the file for Windows and extract it.

4. Copy (or move) the file called **osmcoverer.exe** to **C:\\cygwin\\home\\\<user>** (or any subfolder).

Now you have Cygwin and osmcoverer set up.

### **macOS or Linux prerequisites**
1. Go to [osmcoverer releases](https://github.com/MzHub/osmcoverer/releases), download the file for macOS or Linux and extract it.

2. Open the Terminal app an go to the folder where you have extracted the file (```cd /path_to_the_folder```).

3. Type ```chmod 755 osmcoverer```

4. Type ```mv osmcoverer /usr/local/bin/```

Now you have osmcoverer set up.

## **Set up the script**

### **Windows set up**
1. Clone or download this repo. Then move the files to **C:\\cygwin\\home\\\<user>** (or any subfolder). The file called **<span>getexgyms.sh</span>** has to be in the same folder as **osmcoverer.exe**.

### **macOS or Linux set up**
1. Clone or download this repo. Then move the files to the folder you want to have the output files.

## **How to use**
To run the code type:

```./getexgyms.sh gyms_data.csv exzones_data.geojson blockingzones_data.geojson (--noalias --fixencoding --addheader)```

Where:
* **gyms_data.csv:** file with gyms's data.
    * **Estructure of the csv file:** Name,Latitude,Longitude. **(Do NOT include a header row)**

* **exzones_data.geojson:** exported file from overpass-turbo.eu with EX zones

* **blockingzones_data.geojson:** exported file from overpass-turbo.eu with blocking zones

* **--noalias:** it'll run the commands with ./osmcoverer

* **--fixencoding:** file with blocked gyms will be encoded to MS-ANSI. Might be needed to upload the file to My Maps

* **--addheader:** add a header row. Needed if you want to upload to My Maps

### **Flags**
#### **--noalias**
If this flag is not included then the script will run **osmcoverer** simply as ```osmcoverer```. If you've moved the file to the folder /usr/local/bin (in macOS or Linux) or if you've written an alias in the file _.bashrc_ (or equivalent) the script should find osmcoverer.

If this flag is included then the script will run **osmcoverer** as ```./osmcoverer```. This implies that **osmcoverer** has to be in the same folder as **<span>getexgyms.sh</span>**.

If you've followed the instructions for Windows, you need to include this flag.

#### **--fixencoding**
This flag might be needed if you want to upload the file with blocked gym to My Maps. Otherwise it might happend what is shown in this picture:

![example of wrong encoding](assets/example_of_wrong_encoding.png)

#### **--addheader**
This flag will include a row at the begining of the output files with the text:
> Name,Latitude,Longitude

This is needed if you want to upload the ouput files to My Maps. If you don't do this, the first row of the data will be used as a header.

## **Output data**

Once you have run the script two files are saved in the folder **getexgyms_results**:

### **gyms_data_blocked.csv**
This file contains **all the gyms inside an EX zone that are also inside a blocking zone**. This file is generated by running 2 times osmcoverer:

1. * -markers=gym_data.csv (all gyms)
    
    * \<input file>=exzones_data.geojson

    With this first run, the output file (markers_within_features.csv) contains all gyms inside an EX zone. In my script this equals to the temp file called gym_data_ex_with_blocked.csv.

2. * -markers=markers_within_features.csv (from first run)
    * \<input file>=blockingzones_data.geojson

    With this second run, the output (markers_within_features.csv) contains all gyms inside an EX zone and also a blocking zone. In my script this equals to the file called gyms_data_blocked.csv.

### **gyms_data_ex.csv**
This file is obtained by deleting from the output of the first run (gym_data_ex_with_blocked.csv) all gyms that are in the file of the second run (gyms_data_blocked.csv). So this file only contains **all gyms inside an EX zone but are outside a blocking zone**.

## **Example data**
The data in the _example_data_ folder includes all the gyms in Alcobendas and San Sebasti√°n de los Reyes ("AlcoSanse"), and EX and blocking zones of Madrid.

The area included is this one:
![example of wrong encoding](example_data/area_included_for_queries.png)

## **Run script with the example data**
### **Windows run example**
1. In **Cygwin Terminal** type ```cd /home/<user>``` (or any subfolder).

2. Type ```./getexgyms.sh example_data/gymsAlcoSanse.csv example_data/madrid_exzones.geojson example_data/madrid_blockingzones.geojson --noalias```

The flag **--noalias** runs the code assuming that **osmcoverer** is in the same folder as **<span>getexgyms.sh</span>**
### **macOS or Linux run example**

1. Open the Terminal app an go to the folder where you want to have the output files (```cd /path_to_the_folder```).

2. Type ```./getexgyms.sh example_data/gymsAlcoSanse.csv example_data/madrid_exzones.geojson example_data/madrid_blockingzones.geojson```

## **How to get GeoJSON files**
To get each file you'll have to run a specific query in the website overpass-turbo.eu. In the folder _overpass-turbo_queries_ of this repo there are 2 txt files with the queries for EX and blocking zones but can also use the following links:

### **EX zones query**
Query: https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/HE5

Run the query and then download (export) as a GeoJSON file.

### **Blocking zones query**
Query: https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/HE8

Run the query and then download (export) as a GeoJSON file.
